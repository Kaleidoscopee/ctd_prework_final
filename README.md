# Morning Wakeup

Welcome to the morning drink randomizer!
Just simply choose between Hot or Cold, and then click the "Pick For Me" to be suggested a drink. 




# Journey Journal

Note that this journey goes over multiple Vite attempts and it was decided to scale back and do barebones vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML to be able to turn in the project on time. 

Okay so Hot and Cold works so far, just have to find a way to not only get the api to print to console, but to appear in html consistently. Will probably need to randomize with something like math.random. Will take a quick nap on it since once I can get it working on one it should work on both since the only difference is the end of the URL from hot to iced. 

Alright great, so just copying and pasting the same code over into another cold.js and having my cold.html link to that gives me my cold drinks. And all i had to do was change from hot to iced!
